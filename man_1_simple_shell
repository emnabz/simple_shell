.SH SYNOPSIS
[command_string [arg...][file]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console (i.e., an all-text display mode) or terminal window (an all-text window) in a GUI (graphical user interface) and then execute (i.e., run) them.

TO EDIT:
builtin shell-builtin [arguments]
Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it arguments, and return its exit status. This is useful when defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the functionality of the builtin within the function. This shell currently supports \fBenv\fR and \fBexit\fR

SH.NOTES
This shell current supports the command ls and implements builtins env and exit.

.SH EXAMPLE
To list files in the current directory in interactive mode:
.B ls
